# Power BI Reports from Jupyter Notebook

This project demonstrates how to create a Power BI report from a python dataset (or pandas df) on Jupyter Notebook. You will have the Power BI interface at your disposal to utilize on the dataset. The Power BI report allows you to visualize and analyze the data in an interactive and visually appealing way.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Power BI account

## Installation

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/A-Kilany/Python_for_BI.git

## Install the required dependencies

pip install powerbiclient seaborn

## Usage

Launch Jupyter Notebook and navigate to the project directory.

Open the Jupyter Notebook file (power_bi_report.ipynb).

Run the notebook cells to execute the Python code. The code will:

Connect to your Power BI account using interactive login authentication.
Load the 'iris' dataset from the seaborn library (you can switch to any other dataset you need).
Create a Power BI report from the dataset.
Render and customize the report
