# A series of Business Intelligence projects embedding Jupyter Notebook (Python) and Power BI

This repository contains a series of projects focused on Python and Business Intelligence. Each project demonstrates a different aspect of integrating Python with Business Intelligence tools, specifically Power BI.

## Project List

1. Python_to_PBI: This project showcases how to create a Power BI report from Python. It includes code to connect to Power BI, load data from a dataset (such as a Pandas dataframe), and visualize the data in a Power BI report.

2. PBI_to_Python: This project demonstrates how to extract data from a Power BI report and create a Pandas dataframe in Python. It provides code to connect to Power BI, retrieve data from a dataset, and convert it into a Pandas dataframe for further analysis and processing.

3. Python_to_PBI_Live: This project focuses on sending live data from Jupyter Notebook to a streaming dataset in Power BI. It illustrates how to establish a connection with Power BI, stream data in real-time from Python, and visualize the live data in a Power BI report.

Each project is contained within its respective folder in the repository and includes detailed documentation and code samples to guide you through the process.
